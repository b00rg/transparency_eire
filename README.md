# Transparency Éire
Transparency Éire is a web scraping project aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in government operations by collecting and analyzing data from various government sources.

## Overview
Government transparency is essential for a healthy democracy, enabling citizens to access information about government activities, public spending, legislative updates, government contracts, and regulatory changes. However, accessing and analyzing this data can often be challenging due to its dispersed nature and varying formats. The Government Transparency Tracker addresses this challenge by providing a centralized platform to gather, analyze, and present government data in a user-friendly manner.
